    <h2>  According to § 5 TMG: </h2>

    <h4>  Operator: </h4>
    <p>  Amit Verma  <br>  
        Schäftlarnstraße 72  <br>  81371 Munich </p>

    <h2>  Contact: </h2>
    <p>  Telephone: +4915144036311  <br>  E-Mail: amitverma14ster@gmail.com </p>

    <h2>  Dispute settlement </h2>
    <p>  The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS):  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank">  https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr </a><br>  
        Our e-mail address can be found above in the imprint. </p>

    <p>  We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution procedures before a consumer arbitration board. </p>

    <h2>  Liability for content </h2>

    <p>  As a service provider we are responsible according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG for own contents on these sides according to the general laws.   According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. </p>

    <p>  Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected.   However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement.   Upon notification of appropriate violations, we will remove this content immediately. </p>

    <h2>  Liability for links </h2>

    <p>  Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence.   Therefore we can not assume any liability for these external contents.   The content of the linked pages is always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the pages.   The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.   Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. </p>

    <p>  However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law.   Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately. </p>

    <h2> Copyright </h2>

    <p>  The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law.   The duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator.   Downloads and copies of this site are for private, non-commercial use only. </p>

    <p>  As far as the contents on this side were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are considered.   In particular contents of third parties are marked as such.   Should you still be aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for a note.   Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content immediately. </p>
